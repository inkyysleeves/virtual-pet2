When i was younger i was never allowed pets (well. . .  not after what happened to spike the goldfish RIP)
so now that im older (and hopefully wiser)  i wanted to make a virtual pet using javascript and heres what i accomplished.

This pet has all the following features:
* They can get older
* As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit
* You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness.
* You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 
* You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking
* If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 
* If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE
